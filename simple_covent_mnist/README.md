<h1>Simple Covnet Model trained on MNIST</h1>

This model is the most basic example of a covnet model. We use MaxPooling to seperate the images into 3x3 squares as well as ten layers to evaluate

The accuracy difference between this covnet model and a classification model trained on the same data has a 68%(relatively) increase.

The accuracy for this model is 99%
