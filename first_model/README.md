This model classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative.

validation accuracy = 88%

loss accuracy = 28%

uncomment line 47 to see array of prediction confidence

terminal prints accuracy results (first value is loss, second is validation) at the very end

matplotlib saves accuracy graphs in plots directory

sequential model with 3 layers of vector shape

loss function = bionary_crossentropy

activation = relu

handles crossfitting simply; by lower the number epochs
