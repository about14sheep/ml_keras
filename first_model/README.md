This model classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative.

validation accuracy = 88%
loss accuracy = 28%
uncomment line 47 to see array of prediction confidence
uncomment line 48 to see accuracy results (first value is loss, second is validation)

sequential model with 3 layers of vector shape
loss function = bionary_crossentropy
activation = relu

handles crossfitting simply; by lower the number epochs
