<h1>ml_keras</h1>

My studies on building machine learning models using the keras framework. Mostly follow along work from the book 'Deep Learning with Python'

<h3>Models</h3>

most models will have their own readme with graphs, generated during testing with matplotlib, and a basic overview of bigger take-aways for building the model the way I did.
